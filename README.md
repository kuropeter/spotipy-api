# ðŸŽ§ Extracting Spotify Playlist using Spotipy-API

This project involves extracting and analyzing data from the **Top 100 African Songs** playlist using the Spotify Web API. The extracted data will be used for further visualization, analysis, and the development of a music prediction model and dashboards.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract various features from the Top 100 African SOngs playlist using the Spotify API, focusing on key attributes of each song. The project is divided into two main sections based on the function used to extract the details of the song:

1. **Playlist Data Extraction:** Fetching key details about each song from the playlist.
2. **Audio Features Extraction:** Extracting specific audio features of the songs for deeper analysis.

## ðŸ—‚ Extracted Data Columns

### 1. **Playlist Data Extraction**
These columns are retrieved using the `playlist_items` function from the Spotify API:

- **`song_name`**: Name of the song.
- **`artist`**: Name of the artist.
- **`album_name`**: Name of the album.
- **`artist_id`**: Unique ID of the artist.
- **`song_id`**: Unique ID of the song.
- **`popularity`**: Popularity score of the song (0-100).
- **`explicit`**: Indicates whether the song contains explicit content (True/False).
- **`duration`**: Duration of the song in milliseconds.
- **`release_date`**: Release date of the song (YYYY-MM-DD).
- **`release_year`**: Year the song was released.

### 2. **Audio Features Extraction**
These columns are retrieved using the `audio_features` function from the Spotify API:

- **`key`**: The key the song is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.
- **`danceability`**: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
- **`energy`**: A measure from 0 to 1 representing a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
- **`loudness`**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
- **`mode`**: Modality of the track (Major=1, Minor=0).
- **`speechiness`**: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
- **`acousticness`**: A confidence measure from 0 to 1 of whether the track is acoustic.
- **`instrumentalness`**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.
- **`liveness`**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
- **`valence`**: A measure from 0 to 1 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
- **`tempo`**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).

## ðŸš€ Future Work

- **Music Prediction Model**: Develop a machine learning model to predict music trends based on the extracted features.
- **Dashboards**: Create interactive dashboards for visualizing and analyzing the data.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **API**: Spotify API
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Spotipy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git
